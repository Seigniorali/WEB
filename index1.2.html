    <div id="flip"><h2>Songs and success</h2></div>
    <p class="h4">Starting with imitating the classics of American rock and roll of the 1950s, The Beatles came to their own style and sound. The Beatles had a significant impact on rock music and are recognized by experts as one of the most successful bands of the XX century, both creatively and commercially. Many famous rock musicians admit that they became such under the influence of The Beatles' songs. Since the release of the single "Please Please Me/Ask Me Why" in 1963, the group began its ascent to success, giving rise to a global phenomenon â€” Beatlemania. The quartet became the first British band whose records gained popularity and first places in the US charts, and with it began the worldwide recognition of British bands, as well as the "Liverpool" sound of rock music. The band's musicians and their producer and sound engineer George Martin own innovative developments in the field of sound recording, combining various styles, including symphonic and psychedelic music, as well as filming video clips.</p><br>
